 # Music_Playlist_Generator
The project is a Python-based application that generates 
music playlists on Spotify. It provides users with a simple interface to choose a 
language and mood, and based on their selections, it directs them to the 
appropriate Spotify playlist. Users are presented with a menu to select from a 
variety of languages and moods, and upon making their choices, the 
application opens the corresponding playlist in their default web browser. This 
project leverages the Spotify API to provide users with curated playlists 
matching their preferences, enhancing their music listening experience. With 
its intuitive design and seamless integration with Spotify, the playlist generator 
offers users a convenient way to discover and enjoy music tailored to their 
tastes and moods.
